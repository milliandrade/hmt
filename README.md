# HMT Application

## Demo site
A demo HMT application webpage is avaliable in http://hmtpuc.ddns.net/hmt/ to visualize the application graphical interface and functionalities.

_Note: Functionalities as Grazing track does not work in demo mode, because it needs integration with a farm module._

## Simulation
The farm module can be simulated using the [Herd identification](https://github.com/milliandrade/herd_identification) simulation in GrADyS.
